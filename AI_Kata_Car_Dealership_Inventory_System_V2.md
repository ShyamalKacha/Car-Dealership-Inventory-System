**_TDD Kata: Car Dealership Inventory System_**

**_Objective_**

**_The goal of this kata is to design, build, and test a full-stack Car Dealership Inventory System. This project will test your skills in API development, database management, frontend implementation, testing, and modern development workflows, including the use of AI tools._**

**_Core Requirements_**

**_1\. Backend API (RESTful)_**

**_You are to build a robust backend API that will serve as the brain of the application._**

- **Technology:** Choose one of the following: Node.js/TypeScript (with Express/NestJS), Python (with Django/FastAPI), or Ruby (with Rails).
- **Database:** The application must connect to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite). An in-memory database is not sufficient.
- **User Authentication:**
- Users must be able to register and log in.
- Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to secure certain API endpoints.
- **API Endpoints:**
- **_Auth: POST /api/auth/register, POST /api/auth/login_**
- Vehicles (Protected):
- **_POST /api/vehicles: Add a new vehicle._**
- **_GET /api/vehicles: View a list of all available vehicles._**
- **_GET /api/vehicles/search: Search for vehicles by make, model, category, or price range._**
- **_PUT /api/vehicles/:id: Update a vehicle's details._**
- **_DELETE /api/vehicles/:id: Delete a vehicle (Admin only)._**
- Inventory (Protected):
- **_POST /api/vehicles/:id/purchase: Purchase a vehicle, decreasing its quantity._**
- **_POST /api/vehicles/:id/restock: Restock a vehicle, increasing its quantity (Admin only)._**

**_Each vehicle must have a unique ID, make, model, category, price, and quantity in stock._**

**2\. Frontend Application**

You must build a modern, single-page application (SPA) to interact with your backend API.

- **Technology:** You must use HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind, and React
- **Functionality:**
- User registration and login forms.
- A dashboard or homepage to display all available vehicles.
- Functionality to search and filter vehicles.
- A "Purchase" button on each vehicle, which should be disabled if the quantity is zero.
- (For Admin Users) Forms/UI to add, update, and delete vehicles.
- **Design:** This is a chance to show your creativity. The application should be visually appealing, responsive, and provide a great user experience.

**Process & Technical Guidelines**

**1\. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

Write tests before implementing functionality. We expect to see a clear "Red-Green-Refactor" pattern in your commit history, especially for the backend logic. Aim for high test coverage with meaningful test cases.

**2\. Clean Coding Practices**

Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Follow SOLID principles and other best practices in software design. Your code should be well-documented with meaningful comments and clear naming conventions.

**3\. Git & Version Control**

Use Git for version control. Commit your changes frequently with clear, descriptive messages that narrate your development journey.

**4\. AI Usage Policy (Important)**

We believe AI is a critical tool in the modern software development lifecycle. You are encouraged and expected to use AI tools. However, you must be transparent about it.

- **AI Co-authorship:** For every commit where you used an AI tool (for generating boilerplate, writing tests, debugging, etc.), you must add the AI as a co-author.

_How to add a co-author:_ At the end of your commit message, add two empty lines, followed by the co-author trailer.

**_git commit -m "feat: Implement user registration endpoint_**  
<br/>**_Used an AI assistant to generate the initial boilerplate for the_**  
**_controller and service, then manually added validation logic._**  
<br/>**_Co-authored-by: AI Tool Name &lt;<AI@users.noreply.github.com>&gt;"_**

- **README Documentation:** Your README.md file must include a detailed section titled "My AI Usage". In this section, you must describe:
- Which AI tools you used (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).
- How you used them (e.g., "I used Gemini to brainstorm API endpoint structures," or "I asked Copilot to generate unit tests for my service layer").
- Your reflection on how AI impacted your workflow.
- **Interview Discussion:** Be prepared to discuss your AI usage in detail during the interview. We are interested in how you leverage these tools effectively and responsibly.

**Deliverables**

- A public Git repository link (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab).
- A comprehensive README.md file that includes:
- A clear explanation of the project.
- Detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project locally (both backend and frontend).
- Screenshots of your final application in action.
- The mandatory "My AI Usage" section.
- A test report showing the results of your test suite.
- A PROMPTS.md file that contains your entire AI tooling chat history (including the prompts you wrote) in the root folder of the project.
- (Optional - Brownie Points) A link to the deployed, live application on a platform like Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, or AWS.

**Note:** Plagiarism is strictly forbidden. While we encourage AI assistance, submitting code copied from other repositories or developers will result in immediate rejection. We want to see your work, augmented by modern tools.
